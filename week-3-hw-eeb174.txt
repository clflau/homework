1.11.2: 
1. How many times were the levels of individual 3 recorded?
tail -n +2 Gesquiere2011_data_copy.csv | tr -s t , | grep -c ^3,
61
tail -n +2 Gesquiere2011_data_copy.csv | tr -s t , | grep -c ^27,
5

2. Write a script taking as input the file name and the ID of the individual, and returning the number of records for that ID.
#!/bin/bash

#This script takes 2 arguments: $1 the file name and $2 the ID of individual
#This script returns the number of records for that ID in the file
#It works by first taking $1(a tab-separated file), remove the header, replace tab separation with comma, and search for and count the number of instances of $2


tail -n +2 $1 | tr -s "\t" "," | grep -c ^$2,

---

3. Write a script that returns the number of times each individual was sampled.
#!/bin/bash

#This script functions like record_number.sh, but it takes one argument $1 the file name and returns a list of the number of times each individual was sampled.
#Procedures
#Take $1(a tab-separated file)
#Remove the header
#Replace tab separation with comma
#Cut out the first column
#Pipe to uniq
#Send output to list_of_IDs.txt
#Make while loop, grep search each ID in list_of_IDs.txt in $1 and output number of lines for that ID


tail -n +2 $1 | tr -s "\t" "," | cut -d "," -f 1 | uniq > list_of_IDs.txt
while read ID
	do printf "Individual $ID has been sampled "
		tail -n +2 $1 | tr -s "\t" "," | grep -c ^$ID,
		echo "time(s)"
done < list_of_IDs.txt

1.11.3:
1. Write a script that takes one of these files and determines the number of rows (pollinators) and columns(plants). 
#!bin/bash

#This script takes one argument $1 txt file name
#Print out filename
#replace all spaces into semicolons
#
#Print out number of rows
#Print out number of columns

echo "Filename: $1"
row=$(tail -n +1 $1 | wc -l)
echo "Number of rows: $row" 
col=$(head -n 1 $1 | wc -w)
echo "Number of columns: $col"

---

2. Write a script that prints the number of rows and columns for each network
#!/bin/bash

#This script is similar to netsize.sh, but it prints number of rows and columns for each network file in current directory
#Procedure:
#For loop, print network file name
#number of rows
#number of cols

for filename in *.txt
	do 
		row=$(tail -n +1 $filename | wc -l)
		col=$(head -n 1 $filename | wc -w)
		echo "$filename $row $col"
done

3. Which file has the largest number of rows? Which the largest number of columns?
Largest number of rows: n58.txt, 678 rows
Largest number of columns: n56.txt 207 cols
